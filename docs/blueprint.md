# **App Name**: ChromeChat

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Secure user login and registration with email, password, and username. Redirect to chat page upon successful authentication.
- Chat Interface: Display a welcome message, toggle button (top left), and logo. Implement a minimal chat interface.
- Side Drawer Navigation: Implement a side drawer that opens from the left, displaying the user's name at the top. Include a search box for finding other users by username and sending friend requests.
- Friend Management: Allow users to send and accept friend requests. Display accepted friends under the search box in the side drawer. Clicking a friend's name closes the drawer and opens the chat.
- Real-time Messaging: Enable real-time text messaging between users. Messages should appear quickly on both the sender's and receiver's chat lists. Persist messages.
- Chat Actions: Implement a three-dot button in the top right of the chat interface with options to clear the chat (for both users in real-time) and unfriend the user. Unfriending removes the user from the friend list.
